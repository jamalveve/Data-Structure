## üìö Covered Algorithms

### 1. üîé Linear Search

**Definition:**  
Linear (Sequential) Search goes through each element one by one until it finds the target or reaches the end.

**Purpose:**  
Used when the data is unsorted or the list is small.

**Use Case:**  
Finding a value in a small, unsorted list such as a user search in a dropdown menu.

**Java Code:**  
[View Linear Search Implementation](https://github.com/jamalveve/Data-Structure/blob/main/src/com/ds/SearchingAlgorithms/LinearSearch.java)

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

---

### 2. ‚ö° Binary Search

**Definition:**  
Efficient search for **sorted arrays** by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

**Purpose:**  
Minimize comparisons by cutting down the search space.

**Use Case:**  
Used in sorted arrays like dictionary lookup, database index, pagination, etc.

**Java Code:**  
[View Binary Search Implementation](https://github.com/jamalveve/Data-Structure/blob/main/src/com/ds/SearchingAlgorithms/BinarySearch.java)

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
**Note:** Requires **sorted input**.

---

### 3. ‚è© Jump Search

**Definition:**  
An improvement over linear search that jumps in blocks of fixed size (‚àön) and then performs linear search within the block.

**Purpose:**  
Balances the speed of binary search and simplicity of linear search for **sorted arrays**.

**Use Case:**  
Optimized searches where random access is efficient (e.g., arrays in memory).

**Java Code:**  
[View Jump Search Implementation](https://github.com/jamalveve/Data-Structure/blob/main/src/com/ds/SearchingAlgorithms/JumpSearch.java)

**Time Complexity:** O(‚àön)

## ‚ö° Advanced Searching Algorithm


- ‚ö° **Exponential Search**
- üåÄ **Fibonacci Search**
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Ternary Search**
- üìä **Interpolation Search**

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** All four algorithms assume a **sorted array** as input. For descending order, invert the comparisons accordingly.


---

## 1) ‚ö° Exponential Search

**Definition:**  
Finds a range for the key by **doubling the index (1, 2, 4, 8, ‚Ä¶)**, then applies **Binary Search** within that range.

**Purpose:**  
Great when the element is **near the beginning** or when working with **unbounded / unknown-size** sorted arrays.

**Use Case:**  
Searching in large logs/streams where you cannot know the full size up front.

**Java Code:**
[View Exponential Search Implementation](https://github.com/jamalveve/Data-Structure/blob/main/src/com/ds/SearchingAlgorithms/ExponentialSearch.java)


**Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` (after locating range); Space: `O(1)`


---

## 2) üåÄ Fibonacci Search

**Definition:**  
Uses **Fibonacci numbers** to split the array into sections, reducing division cost (relying mostly on addition/subtraction).

**Purpose:**  
Useful on systems where **division/modulo is expensive** compared to addition/subtraction.

**Use Case:**  
Embedded systems or constrained environments with limited arithmetic support.

**Java Code:**
[View Fibonacci Search Implementation](https://github.com/jamalveve/Data-Structure/blob/main/src/com/ds/SearchingAlgorithms/FibonacciSearch.java)

**Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`; Space: `O(1)`


---

## 3) ‚öñÔ∏è Ternary Search

**Definition:**  
Splits the search space into **three parts** using two mid points and discards two-thirds each iteration.

**Purpose:**  
Primarily used to find **optimum (min/max)** of a **unimodal function**. It can also search in sorted arrays, though **Binary Search** is typically preferred for equality search.

**Use Case:**  
Optimization over a discrete domain or searching a peak in a unimodal array.

**Java Code**

[View Ternary Search Implementation](https://github.com/jamalveve/Data-Structure/blob/main/src/com/ds/SearchingAlgorithms/TernarySearch.java)

**Time Complexity:** `O(log‚ÇÉ n)` (‚âà `1.26 * log‚ÇÇ n`); Space: `O(1)`


---

## 4) üìä Interpolation Search

**Definition:**  
Estimates the probable position of the target using **linear interpolation** based on value distribution, then narrows the range.

**Purpose:**  
Extremely fast on **uniformly distributed** keys (e.g., evenly spread numeric IDs).

**Use Case:**  
Lookup in large **uniform** numeric datasets: membership IDs, phone numbers, sorted logs.

**Java Code:**
[View Interpolation Search Implementation](https://github.com/jamalveve/Data-Structure/blob/main/src/com/ds/SearchingAlgorithms/InterpolationSearch.java)



**Time Complexity:** Average `O(log log n)`; Worst `O(n)` (when distribution is highly skewed); Space: `O(1)`
