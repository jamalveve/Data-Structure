# 🔍 Mastering Searching Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my repository on **Searching Algorithms** – a key topic in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) that every developer should master.

This project includes clean and beginner-friendly **Java implementations** of essential searching techniques, complete with explanations, use cases, and time complexities.

> ✅ Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, building real-world applications, or teaching others—this collection is designed to give you a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking.

## 📚 Covered Algorithms

### 1. 🔎 Linear Search

**Definition:**  
Linear (Sequential) Search goes through each element one by one until it finds the target or reaches the end.

**Purpose:**  
Used when the data is unsorted or the list is small.

**Use Case:**  
Finding a value in a small, unsorted list such as a user search in a dropdown menu.

**Java Code:**

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

### 2. ⚡ Binary Search

**Definition:**  
Efficient search for **sorted arrays** by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

**Purpose:**  
Minimize comparisons by cutting down the search space.

**Use Case:**  
Used in sorted arrays like dictionary lookup, database index, pagination, etc.

**Java Code:**

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
**Note:** Requires **sorted input**.

### 3. ⏩ Jump Search

**Definition:**  
An improvement over linear search that jumps in blocks of fixed size (√n) and then performs linear search within the block.

**Purpose:**  
Balances the speed of binary search and simplicity of linear search for **sorted arrays**.

**Use Case:**  
Optimized searches where random access is efficient (e.g., arrays in memory).

**Java Code:**

**Time Complexity:** O(√n)
